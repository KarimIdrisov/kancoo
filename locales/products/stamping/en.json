  "description": "We would like to point out why so many companies choose us: <br/><br/>1. Terms of manufacturing of technologically simple stamps we fulfill in 20-25 days, successive large stamps, depending on complexity, approximately 45 days. Many customers bet on this, as in Russia these terms reach up to 3 months.<br/><br/>2. High quality of assembly, precision manufacturing! Constant control of production, Russian specialists on site, with photo video reports, Skype conferences.<br/><br/>3. Not a little important in this industry is the lack of language barrier between the engineer from the Chinese side and the customer, it will provide you with Russian translators working in our company.<br/><br/>4. The most important thing is the price! We are always ready to meet and offer a reasonable price that would suit you.<br/><br/>5. Each stamp, at the request of the customer, issue a full set of documentation (drawings, 2D 3D models on request) translated into Russian, which are included in the cost of the order.<br/><br/>6. Production of any tooling, parts, on demand and drawing of the customer.",

          "p": "Sequencing stamps play an important role in the production of metal parts in various industries. They allow multiple operations to be performed simultaneously or sequentially on a single press, which increases process efficiency and reduces production time. <br/><br/>Here are some of the basic operations that can be performed using sequential dies:<br/>1. Forming: Stamps can be used to form metal, change its shape and create the required geometry of the part.<br/>2. Punching: Press dies can be used to punch holes, extrude holes, or perform other operations that involve punching metal.<br/>3. Punching: Stamps can also be used to punch out parts from a metal plate. This may include cutting out contours, holes, or other shapes."
