          "p": "Sequencing stamps play an important role in the production of metal parts in various industries. They allow multiple operations to be performed simultaneously or sequentially on a single press, which increases process efficiency and reduces production time. <br/><br/>Here are some of the basic operations that can be performed using sequential dies:<br/>1. Forming: Stamps can be used to form metal, change its shape and create the required geometry of the part.<br/>2. Punching: Press dies can be used to punch holes, extrude holes, or perform other operations that involve punching metal.<br/>3. Punching: Stamps can also be used to punch out parts from a metal plate. This may include cutting out contours, holes, or other shapes."

Modern equipment: In the process of mechanical processing of workpieces we use high-tech machines with numerical control (CNC) from well-known world manufacturers. This allows us to ensure high accuracy and efficiency of production.<br/>2. Qualified personnel: Our specialists have many years of experience in working on machine tools and have in-depth knowledge of metalworking. This ensures that every part goes through the manufacturing process with the utmost precision and attention to detail.<br/>3. Heat Treatment: To improve the performance of the parts, we use various heat treatment methods such as thermal vacuum carburizing and hardening, normalization, surface hardening and others, depending on the grade of metal. This increases the strength and durability of our products.<br/>4. Quality control: The entire production process is accompanied by quality control specialists who strictly monitor compliance with technological norms and standards. The intermediate technical parameters of the blanks are closely monitored."
